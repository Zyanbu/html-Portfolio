<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Juan Reyes and I'm currently a undergraduate studying computer science. I'm making this Profolio as a personal project because I want to learn how to become a full stack developer and this is my first step towards my goal.</p>

<p>My passions are sports, videogames, and coding. I feel like there's a lot of things I want to learn but not enough time in a day. But still I will keep trying to learn as much as I can.</p>

<p>I think its important to have a sort of motivation that pushes you when you feel down. And for me that is my family. Specifically my little sister, I want to be a good role model for her so she can have someone to look up to. Hopefully, One day she can also relay on me. </p>
